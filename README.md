RomanToDecimal
==============

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from Roman Numerals to decimal numerals. 
<br> In order to keep the kata light, we will not check for valid Roman Numeral.
<br> Roman numerals, the numeral system of ancient Rome, uses combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values. 
<br>
<br>
<br>They are based on seven symbols:
<br>Symbol	Value
<br>I	1
<br>V	5
<br>X	10
<br>L	50
<br>C	100
<br>D	500
<br>M	1000
<br>
<br>Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. 
<br>Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values. 
<br>When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total.
<br>
<br>Example:
<br>Roman Number  Computation                                 Value     Comment
<br>MMVI          1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1                         2006      only addition
<br>MCMXLIV       1000 + (1000 - 100) + (50 - 10) + (5 - 1)   1944      addition and substraction
